# Connect using an OpenVPN client application<a name="linux"></a>

The following procedures show how to establish a VPN connection using OpenVPN\-based VPN clients\.

Before you begin, ensure that your Client VPN administrator has [created a Client VPN endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-working-endpoints.html#cvpn-working-endpoint-create) and provided you with the [Client VPN endpoint configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-working-endpoint-export.html)\.

For troubleshooting information, see [Linux troubleshooting](linux-troubleshooting.md)\.

**Important**  
If the Client VPN endpoint has been configured to use [SAML\-based federated authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/client-authentication.html#federated-authentication), you cannot use the OpenVPN\-based VPN client to connect to a Client VPN endpoint\.
